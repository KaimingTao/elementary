## Simple data management

Version: 2025-07-05


This simple document is for people who have many files, and meet problems about

1. how to categorize and organize them
2. how to store them safely


## Expectations

- It's not possible to do it perfectly, some issues will always be there
    - messy folders
    - missing files
    - broken hardware
    - safety issue
- The vital questions is, which things we care the most


## How to categorize files

Files and data should be separated into these categories for reducing confusion for ourselves

1. personal file and data
2. project related data
    - notes
    - project works
3. collected data from others


## Organize project files

Project can stay for a long time, some ideas tried and getting keep, something in pending, something being deleted.

- Organizing files by date is a good option.
- Organizing files by sub projects

Things are evolving, so the best way is that we have clear mind, and understand what we're doing


## Storage

- Don't store data in your PC or Mac or computer
    - when your computer is lost, you lost everything
    - have some backup
    - Although backing up files are boring, losting data is the irresolvable trouble, more sever problem.
- If you're good at using computer, consider to have a NAS like server
    - I **DON'T** recommend any commercial NAS products, just use Linix + Samba + encrypted HDD is enough
    - Have 3 copy of your data, one in the computer, two offline
    - You don't have to keep the NAS 24/7, only when you need it
    - Don't use big scale disk like 10T+
        - the problems is mirroring the disk is slow
        - and when a harddisk is broken, you need waste hours to rebuild it from new one.
        - SSD is not good for long time off-power storage.
- Use some cloud data storage
    - only for non sensitive data
    - commercial cloud storage services promise they encrypt your data, but
        - you cannot prove it, they cannot neither
        - if encryption algorithms get broken by quantum computer, none of your data is safe
    - expect you data will be accessed by others you don't know in the future

### Data security

- No absolutely safe solution exists, but some are better than others.
- The best way for data security is to not record the data, but we still need to know something.
- The second best way for data security from unknown person to access data is to always offline.
    - it won't prevent you from lost data at home, like computer failure.

- If you want to share files between different computers in local Wi-Fi network
    - NAS or customized NAS is good enough
- If you want to share files remotely, some Cloud storage service is good enough.
    - Still choose the service that claim the encrypt the data.
    - I don't fully trust them because it's a black box
    - The cloud storage is mostly bigger than the storage size of your local computer, so the true file won't be stored in your local machine by just a placeholder, when you access it, the software will download it. Which means for file you always want to access even without internet, It's not a good solution.
- For important data, store self-encrypted version in cloud service, and also a local copy.
