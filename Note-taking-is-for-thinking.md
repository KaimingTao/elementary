# Note taking is for thinking

Version: 2025-05-24

Note-taking is to **help us think**, without this in mind, using any tool is aiming for a problematic goal that takes myriads of time for perfection but achieving nothing.

In the note-taking community the hot topics are always about tools, methods, etc... which is misleading. Pretty and clean notes looks nice, but real-world thinking process is always **complicated**, because that's how the world works.

I guess sometimes people get confused by their notes and the things they want to publish. Notes are drafts of thinking, they won't be published anyway. If we check the published drafts by famous designers, they're obscure and incomprehensible, because that fits to their ways of thinking, not designed for others.

Using AI to take notes means, lack of thinking, it's not note taking. Notes remind us the thing we don't have to remember, and mind can use it's power more for thinking.

## Don't take notes for everything

- The number of ways to combine ideas or knowledge is bigger bigger bigger than the number of atoms in this universe
- For achieving a goal, the purpose is not to build a library that contains everything, and that thing won't exist in this world anyway
- The key question is what are **information**, what are **noise**, noises won't help us think
- Although this document can help you manage thousands of notes, projects and topics, the goal is not this, the goal is to think, to try, and to make things done.
- When we take notes, we also collect some documents, files. Current fashion around the world is to collect as much as possible, and to digest as less as possible. That's bad habit.

## How to organize notes

- As mentioned above, notes are for thinking, as long as you can use the notes for your work, the whole thing is in good shape. Until you cannot use it think, then some cleanup work is required.

- Notes can be organized by projects, that's clear that these notes are related to a specific work
- Notes can be organized by topics
- For notes we don't know where to categorize it, save then using today's date

- Many notes can be categorized into multiple topics
	- saving into projects normally is better than topics, because projects have more clear goals
	- duplication of ideas is not a problem, ideas under different topics have different connotation, because the context are different.
